<h1> About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello! I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in the mathematical sciences department at RPI writing a dissertation on the use of nonconvex regularizers for low rank models with applications in power systems, machine learning, and computer vision.

I also write blog posts about how machine learning practitioners can use techniques that are of interest in the mathematical optimization research community. From talking to people who use machine learning in industry, I’ve found that there’s a gap between what gets used in industry and what gets studied in academia, and I hope to help bring the two closer together.
</p>
<h1>
Research Interests
</h1>
<p>
In general, I study nonconvex optimization techniques for machine learning. My work recently has been on Matrix Completion and Robust PCA, with applications in data analysis for power systems. 

Previously, I have done research on nonconvex optimization techniques in Bioinformatics, which is something I hope to do more of in the future
