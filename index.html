<h1> About Me</h1>
<p>
 Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow working in the <a href="https://www.osmanbeyoglulab.com/">Osmanbeyoglu Lab</a> at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Biomedical Informatics and UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. Before that, I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics at RPI, and my dissertation was on the use of nonconvex regularizers for low rank and sparse models in machine learning/data science.

</p>
<h1>
Research Interests
</h1>
<p>
 My current work is focused on computationally modeling gene regulatory networks and transcriptional programs using machine learning approaches on multi-omic data, and applying the methods I develop to study gene and transcription factor dysregulation in cancer.  
 <br>
 I also work on low-rank and sparse models for machine learning and data science.  I am actively developing and maintaining a python package, <a href="spalor.org">SpaLoR</a>, with the goal of making state of the art methods that are studied in the machine learning and optimization research community more widely available to data science practitioners.
